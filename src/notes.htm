<h1>PHP Address Book Version 8.2.x</h1>
<a href="#1">requirements</a> | <a href="#2">installation</a> | <a href="#3">licence</a> | <a href="#4">disclaimer</a>

<h3>Intro:</h3>
<p>This is an address book program for people who have their own web space. I wrote it because I wanted a place  <br>where I could store all my addresses so I can access them from multiple locations, and it's a handy backup if you lose your address book, <br> and there weren't any freeware programs that suited my needs. IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL USE. </p>

<h3>User Features</h3>
- Address and birthday management.<br />
- Address grouping and mailing.<br />
- Phonebook printing.<br />
- Birthday reminder list.<br />
- vCard an csv export capabilities.<br />
- Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail integrations.<br />
- Many translations.<br />
- Google map integration.<br />
- User management in database.<br />
- iPhone + Android connection support (beta, on demand).

<h3><a name="1"></a>Download:</h3>
<p>For the most recent version go to: <b><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-addressbook/" target="_blank">php-addressbook</a>.</b></p>

<h3><a name="1"></a>Requirements:</h3>
<p>You will need a webserver which has installed PHP 5, and mySQL version 4 upwards.</p>

<h3><a name="2"></a>Installation:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Unzip the files and place them on your webserver (or locally, as you will have to make some changes and then upload) in a directory called addressbook or whatever.</li><br>
<li>Open <b>config.php</b> and change the variables to your server specification.</li><br>
<li>You need to create the table 'addressbook' in your mySQL database (you can alter the table name, <br>but you need to change the entry in config.php, and the table name in addressbook.sql). <br>Either via telnet, or using a program such as <a href="http://www.anse.de/mysqlfront/" target="_blank">mySQLfront</a>, or <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> enter the information stored in <b>addressbook.sql</b>. <br>You can create a separate database for the addressbook, it's up to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!</p>

<h3>Technical Features</h3>
- Full UTF-8 support.<br />
- Browser language detection.<br />
- Fast AJAX-Search.<br />
- Page compression for bandwidth saving.

<p><b>Optional extras:</b></p>
<p>You might want to password protect the addressbook - not everyone wants to have their details freely available on the web! It is HIGHLY recommended that you do.  <br>Password proctection is best done with .htaccess and .htpassword files. There are tutorials out there to help.</p>
<p>You can move the config.php file to another directory if you want to make it safer - just remember to alter the include( ) statement in dbconnect.php.</p>
